   quote: "<strong>ScanGov has been a game-changer for our work on government websites.</strong> Their standards give us exactly what we need to make informed decisions. When we're prioritizing which security and accessibility issues to address, their unbiased metrics provide clear direction. I've found myself pulling up their reports during client meetings to back up our recommendationsâ€”it's much more convincing than just saying 'trust us.' Their focus on making government sites work better for everyone completely aligns with values of our team."
