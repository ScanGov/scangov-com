We're excited to announce that Aaron Hans has joined the [ScanGov team](https://docs.scangov.org/people) as a maintainer. 

## About Aaron  

Aaron has contributed to civic tech since 2018.

He led the safe drinking water group at Code for America’s Open Oakland brigade, where the team won the California Safe Drinking Water Data Challenge. The project explored the contaminants affecting the drinking water of one million Californians.  

Aaron was part of California's [Alpha project](https://alpha.ca.gov), which introduced user-centered design to the state and shipped 20 prototypes during an experimental 90-day timeframe. He subsequently led the development of [California's COVID-19 response site](https://calendar.perfplanet.com/2022/faster-data-visualizations/).  

In 2021, the governor appointed Aaron to California’s [Office of Data and Innovation](https://innovation.ca.gov/), where he helped [define the state's tech direction for the Design System](https://innovation.ca.gov/blog/posts/tech-choices-in-the-california-design-system/).  

Aaron was a founding engineer at CoProcure (now Pavilion) and a principal front-end engineer at ZapLabs. He has held front-end and full-stack development roles since the 1990s.
