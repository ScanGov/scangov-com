## 2025 Government Experience Awards 🏆

ScanGov will again provide essential data support for [e.Republic’s Center for Digital Government 2025 Government Experience Awards](https://docs.scangov.org/news/government-experience-awards-2025), contributing critical quantitative metrics to the judging process.

CDG Chief Program Officer Teri Takai:

> “By incorporating ScanGov’s expanded data capabilities into our evaluation process, we’re deepening our understanding of what defines a leading digital government experience—from accessibility to laying the foundation for AI, this layer of insight is invaluable in identifying the jurisdictions setting the gold standard for service delivery.”

## What they say 🗣️

Lullabot VP of Extended Support David Burns:

> “ScanGov has been a game-changer for our work on government websites. Their standards give us exactly what we need to make informed decisions. When we're prioritizing which security and accessibility issues to address, their unbiased metrics provide clear direction. I've found myself pulling up their reports during client meetings to back up our recommendations—it's much more convincing than just saying 'trust us.' Their focus on making government sites work better for everyone completely aligns with the values of our team.”

## Standards ☀️

There’s now a single source of truth for our [government digital experience standards](https://standards.scangov.org/). These are based on [guidance](https://standards.scangov.org/guidance/) across public policy, web protocol, guidelines and best practices.

## Demo 🎬

## Press 🗞️

ScanGov in the news.

Houston Landing: [Houston-area cities and counties want you to go to their websites. How useful are they?](https://houstonlanding.org/houston-area-cities-and-counties-want-you-to-go-to-their-websites-how-useful-are-they/)

> At the request of the Houston Landing, 35 Houston-area government websites were evaluated by ScanGov. Most, like Houston and Harris County, received overall failing grades, though some scored well on content and performance. Many, however, failed to meet security and accessibility standards.
