[Project ScanGov](https://scangov.org) now has a [map](https://scangov.org/map/states/overall/) that visualizes how U.S. states fare on government digital experience. Each state on the map is clickable to a full government digital experience report card.

The grades are based on scans of state government website homepages and how each fares on key indicators. Indicators are based on [government digital experience standards](https://standards.scangov.org) that account for:

- Accessibility
- Content
- Domain
- Performance
- Search engine optimization
- Security
- Social media
