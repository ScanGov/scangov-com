We added a new [ScanGov](https://scangov.org) indicator that grades/scores federal and state government websites based on basic web security practices.

## Why it matters &#128680;

Government agencies must incorporate web security throughout every phase of website and digital service design and development.

## What we monitor &#128994;

* [Content Security Policy](/content-security-policy)
* [HTTP Strict Transport Security](/https-hsts)
* [X-Content-Type-Options](/x-content-type-options)
* [security.txt](/security-txt)

## Grades/scores &#129489;&#8205;&#127979;

- [Overall](https://scangov.org/?field=security&level=1): F / 27%
- [Federal](https://scangov.org/?field=security&level=2): F / 27%
- [States](https://scangov.org/?field=security&level=3): F / 31%
