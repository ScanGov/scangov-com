We’re excited to officially launch [ScanGov Standards](https://standards.scangov.org), government digital experience standards based on guidance from public policy, web protocol, guidelines and best practices.

The standards holistically address key areas of the digital experience:

* [Accessibility](https://standards.scangov.org/accessibility/)  
* [AI-friendly](https://standards.scangov.org/aifriendly/)  
* [Content](https://standards.scangov.org/content/)  
* [Domain](https://standards.scangov.org/domain/)  
* [Performance](https://standards.scangov.org/performance/)  
* [Search engine optimization](https://standards.scangov.org/seo/)  
* [Security](https://standards.scangov.org/security/)  
* [Social media](https://standards.scangov.org/social/)

## Guidance

These standards are based on [guidance](https://standards.scangov.org/guidance) from public policy, government recommendations, protocol and best practices.

This includes the [21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act (IDEA)](https://standards.scangov.org/21stcenturyidea), [CISA Cybersecurity Performance Goals](https://standards.scangov.org/cybersecurity-performance-goals), [Google Search Central](https://standards.scangov.org/google-search-central), [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://standards.scangov.org/wcag) and more.

## The problem

Governments and their technology vendors don’t holistically address digital experience. This results in sub-standard public digital services, which leads to frustration and distrust. Current [Project ScanGov](https://scangov.org) report cards show the average overall grade is an ‘F’.

General:

* Too many policies, protocol, guidelines and best practices to track.  
* Researching and understanding these is resource-intensive.

Governments:

* Aren’t holistically informed on digital experience best standards/guidance.  
* Don't prioritize digital service delivery.

Vendors: 

* Don’t fully adopt standards into their services/software.  
* Deliver “good enough for government” technology.

## The solution

By mapping guidance to specific standards across digital experience indicators, government and vendors can better align on expectations and objectives and deliver exceptional public digital services.

## Why it matters

The public experiences government digital services in many ways:

* Web (websites, web applications)  
* Search engines (Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing)  
* Social media (LinkedIn, Facebook, X, Bluesky)  
* Mobile applications  
* AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Anthropic)

By following standards based on policy and web best practices, governments can deliver better holistic digital experiences that meet user needs and expectations wherever they are.

## We want your feedback

If you have input on new or current [standards](https://standards.scangov.org/) and [guidance](https://standards.scangov.org/guidance/), we encourage your [feedback](https://docs.scangov.org/feedback).

We’ll continue to build on our work ([backlog](https://github.com/ScanGov/standards/issues)), but we know that this effort will be more impactful with engagement from the public – government, vendors and the public at large.
