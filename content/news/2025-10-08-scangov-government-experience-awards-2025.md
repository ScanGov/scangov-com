[ScanGov](https://scangov.com) is proud to have supported e.Republic’s [Center for Digital Government](https://www.govtech.com/cdg) 2025 [Government Experience Awards](https://www.govtech.com/cdg/government-experience) (GovX) judging with quantitative website scan data from [Project ScanGov](https://scangov.org).

From the [2025 award winners announcement](https://www.govtech.com/government-experience-awards-2025-winners-announced):

> As part of the quantitative scoring process, CDG also leveraged ScanGov, an open-source evaluation tool that monitors the performance and health of official government websites, mobile platforms, and social media channels.

“The Government Experience Awards highlight how agencies are moving forward with emerging technologies like AI while keeping accessibility front and center,” said Dustin Haisler, President of e.Republic. “This year’s winners show that innovation in government works best when it combines the right technologies with experiences that people can trust.”
