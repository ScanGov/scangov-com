## ScanGov

[ScanGov](https://scangov.com/) is a government digital experience platform that helps public agencies monitor, improve, and maintain their websites. The service combines automated scanning with clear guidance to help government teams deliver better online services to the public through standards-based improvements.

## The problem

- Government websites often fail to meet basic accessibility, security, and performance standards
- IT teams lack tools to monitor multiple sites and prioritize fixes effectively
- Citizens struggle to access government services online due to poor digital experiences
- Agencies spend resources on low-impact improvements while critical issues remain unaddressed
- Manual website audits are time-consuming and inconsistent across organizations

## The solution

- Automated scanning across eight key areas: accessibility, security, performance, SEO, content, AI-readiness, domain management, and social media
- Real-time monitoring with letter grades (A-F) based on measurable standards
- Impact-based task prioritization that focuses effort where it matters most
- Pre-built bug reports and GitHub integration for streamlined development workflows
- Public dashboards that provide transparency and accountability for digital services

## Why it matters

- Better government websites mean citizens can access services more easily and efficiently
- Standardized metrics help agencies make data-driven decisions about digital improvements
- Accessibility compliance ensures equal access to government services for all citizens
- Security standards protect both agencies and the public from cyber threats
- Performance improvements reduce costs and increase user satisfaction

## Context

Government digital services face unique challenges that private sector tools don't address. Unlike commercial websites, government sites must serve everyone equally, follow strict [accessibility requirements](https://standards.scangov.org/), and maintain high [security standards](https://standards.scangov.org/) while operating under budget constraints.

Current state of government websites
The average government website receives a [C grade with a 73% score](https://scangov.org/) across more than 1,100 monitored sites. This reveals significant room for improvement in serving the public effectively online.

Industry recognition
ScanGov supports the [Center for Digital Government's Government Experience Awards](https://scangov.com/government-experience-awards/), providing the data foundation for identifying leading digital government experiences. As one industry professional noted, the platform's unbiased metrics provide clear direction when prioritizing security and accessibility issues.

Multi-layered approach
The platform operates on two levels:
- [ScanGov commercial platform](https://scangov.com/): Paid service offering comprehensive management tools, multi-site monitoring, and development integration
- [Project ScanGov](https://scangov.org/): Free public monitor that tracks and grades government websites for transparency

Standards foundation
All measurements are based on established [public policy, web protocols, and industry best practices](https://standards.scangov.org/). This ensures recommendations align with government requirements rather than generic web advice.

Pricing accessibility
[Plans](https://scangov.com/plans) range from free starter accounts to enterprise solutions, making the platform available to organizations of all sizes. The tiered structure allows agencies to scale their digital experience management as needs grow.
