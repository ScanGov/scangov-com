## ScanGov

[ScanGov](https://scangov.com/) is a government digital experience platform that helps public agencies monitor, improve, and maintain their websites. The service combines automated scanning with clear guidance to help government teams deliver better online services to the public through standards-based improvements.

## Context

[Government digital experience](/government-digital-experience) faces unique challenges that private sector tools don't address. Unlike commercial websites, government sites must serve everyone equally, follow strict [accessibility requirements](https://standards.scangov.org/accessibility/), and maintain high [security standards](https://standards.scangov.org/security) while operating under budget constraints.

Digital experience teams and government leaders want to deliver great digital services to the public. However, there's a lot to understand and stay on top of when it comes to technical implementation. ScanGov was built by people who experienced this pain point firsthand. Even teams with years of experience building websites and applications may have blind spots. A seamless way to monitor  progress across multiple sites and standards helps keep the team on top of all aspects of digital service delivery.

## The problem

- Citizens struggle with poor experiences
- Government sites fail basic standards
- Digital/IT teams lack holistic monitoring tools 
- Agencies focus on low-impact improvements
- Manual audits are time-consuming

## The solution

- Automated scanning across eight key areas
- Real-time monitoring with letter grades
- Impact-based task prioritization
- Pre-built bug reports and GitHub integration
- Public dashboards for transparency

## Why it matters

- Better services mean easier citizen access
- Standardized metrics enable data-driven decisions
- Accessibility compliance ensures equal access
- Security standards protect agencies and public
- Performance improvements reduce costs

## How it's going

The average government digital service receives a [C grade with a 73% score](https://scangov.org/) across more than 1,100 monitored sites. This reveals significant room for improvement in serving the public effectively online.

## Guidance

The [ScanGov guidance](https://standards.scangov.org/guidance/) draws from established public policy, web protocols, and industry best practices to create actionable standards for government websites. This evidence-based approach ensures that recommendations align with government requirements and proven methods rather than generic web advice.

Examples:
- [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) - Rules for making websites accessible
- [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) - Improves accessibility, consistency and user experience
- [Google Search Console](https://developers.google.com/search) - Resources to improve site search rankings
- [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)](https://www.cisa.gov/website-security) - Voluntary, high-impact security practices
- [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/) - Google's speed, interaction, and stability metrics

## Standards

The [ScanGov standards](https://standards.scangov.org/) translate established guidance into specific, measurable requirements for government websites. These standards provide clear benchmarks that help agencies understand exactly what needs to be implemented to improve their digital services.
