## ScanGov

[ScanGov](https://scangov.com/) is a government digital experience platform that helps public agencies monitor, improve, and maintain their websites. The service combines automated scanning with clear guidance to help government teams deliver better online services to the public through standards-based improvements.

## Context

Government digital services face unique challenges that private sector tools don't address. Unlike commercial websites, government sites must serve everyone equally, follow strict [accessibility requirements](https://standards.scangov.org/), and maintain high [security standards](https://standards.scangov.org/) while operating under budget constraints.

Digital experience teams and government leaders want to deliver great digital services to the public. However, there's a lot to understand and stay on top of when it comes to technical implementation. ScanGov was built by people who experienced this pain point firsthand. Even though they have years of experience building websites and applications, they weren't holistically versed on all of the key digital experience indicators and had no easy, seamless way to monitor their progress across multiple sites and standards.

## The problem

- Government digital services often fail to meet basic [accessibility](https://scangov.com/indicators/accessibility/), [security](https://scangov.com/indicators/security/), and [performance](https://scangov.com/indicators/performance/) standards
- IT teams lack tools to monitor multiple sites and prioritize fixes effectively
- Citizens struggle to access government services online due to poor digital experiences
- Agencies spend resources on low-impact improvements while critical issues remain unaddressed
- Manual audits of digital services are time-consuming and inconsistent across organizations

## The solution

- Automated scanning across eight key areas: [accessibility](https://scangov.com/indicators/accessibility/), [security](https://scangov.com/indicators/security/), [performance](https://scangov.com/indicators/performance/), [SEO](https://scangov.com/indicators/seo/), [content](https://scangov.com/indicators/content/), [AI-readiness](https://scangov.com/indicators/ai-friendly/), [domain management](https://scangov.com/indicators/domain/), and [social media](https://scangov.com/indicators/social/)
- Real-time monitoring with [letter grades (A-F)](https://docs.scangov.org/grades) based on measurable standards
- [Impact-based task prioritization](https://docs.scangov.org/impact) that focuses effort where it matters most
- Pre-built bug reports and GitHub integration for streamlined development workflows
- Public dashboards that provide transparency and accountability for digital services

## Why it matters

- Better government digital services mean citizens can access services more easily and efficiently
- Standardized metrics help agencies make data-driven decisions about digital improvements
- Accessibility compliance ensures equal access to government services for all citizens
- Security standards protect both agencies and the public from cyber threats
- Performance improvements reduce costs and increase user satisfaction

## How it's going

The average government digital service receives a [C grade with a 73% score](https://scangov.org/) across more than 1,100 monitored sites. This reveals significant room for improvement in serving the public effectively online.
